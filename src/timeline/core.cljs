; ----------
; * Register a listener to tell this component to react to the state.
;   - `app-state` is the reference to the atom
;   - `state` is the value, which gets refreshed each time the atom is updated
;      (but is not actually the source of truth reference itself)

; TODO: Decide what to render in the case where a single date occurs >1x
; (e.g. in the HOPL example)
