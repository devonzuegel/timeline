    The objective for Clojure can be summarized most succinctly as: I wanted a
    language as acceptable as Java or C#, but supporting a much simpler programming
    model, to use for the kinds of information system development I had been doing
    professionally.

    I started working on Clojure in
    <span class="timeline-item" id="inline-date--2005-1">2005</span>, during a
    sabbatical I funded out of retirement savings. The purpose of the sabbatical was
    to give myself the opportunity to work on whatever I found interesting, without
    regard to outcome, commercial viability or the opinions of others. One might say
    these are prerequisites for working on Lisps or functional languages. I budgeted
    for two years of self-directed work, and Clojure was one of two projects I
    pursued. After about a year I decided the other project (a cochlear modeling and
    machine listening problem) was more of a research endeavor that might require two
    to five more years, so I dedicated myself at that point to getting Clojure to a
    useful state. I announced and released the first version of Clojure, as an open
    source project, in the fall of
    <span id="inline-date--2007" class="timeline-item">2007</span>. I did 100% of the
    implementation work during this time, and more than 90% through the 1.2 release
    in 2010. Subsequent to release Clojure benefited greatly from the feedback,
    suggestions and effort of its community. I am accepted by the community as
    “benevolent dictator for life” (BDFL) and continue to make all decisions relating
    to its evolution. Clojure is full of the great ideas of others, but I alone take
    responsibility for its faults.

  <h2>2 BACKGROUND AND MOTIVATION</h2>

  <h3>2.1 Tuesday Afternoon</h3>

  <p>
    I had been doing commercial software development since 1987, almost always as the
    development lead and primary architect, first in C++, then Java and C#, as was
    common then and, in testament to institutional inertia, is still now thirty years
    later. I worked on scheduling systems, broadcast automation, yield management,
    audio recognition, exit poll tabulation and election projection et al. I would
    broadly characterize my work, and the work most commonly done by professional
    pro- grammers, as information systems programming. Most developers are primarily
    engaged in making systems that acquire, extract, transform, maintain, analyze,
    transmit and render information—facts about the world. Most often, this
    information documents some human activity, be that of customers, suppliers,
    advertisers, travelers, voters, members, students, patients etc and must deal
    with all the irregularity thereof. This is in stark contrast to artificial
    systems, e.g., programming language compilers, which make up their own rules, in
    fully enumerated spaces, can eliminate irregularity and can reject anything which
    does not conform.
  </p>

  <p>
    Information system programmers have the thankless task of attempting to
    superimpose some- what regular models over information and real-world activity
    that refuses to comply. For instance, in music scheduling, trying to decide:
    whether artists have songs or songs have artists. Or optimizing a scheduler to
    spread out the plays of songs by each artist, except on ‘twofer Tuesdays’ when
    songs by each artist must be played in adjacent pairs. In information systems
    programming, twofer Tuesdays are everywhere.
  </p>

  <h3>2.2 I’m a Believer</h3>

  <p>
    By the mid 1990’s I was a C++ expert, taught advanced C++ as an adjunct at NYU,
    and was a proponent and advocate of the benefits of static typing (but neglected
    the tradeoffs, sorry students!). I was happily discovering type parameterization
    tricks [Hickey 1996], running a const-correct shop etc.
  </p>

  <p>
    However, over time, in my experience, the suitability-to-task of these statically
    typed class models for information systems programming was quite low, and the
    benefits of the type checking minimal, especially in addressing the number one
    actual problem faced by programmers: the overwhelming

  <p>A History of Clojure 71:3</p>

  <p>
    complexity inherent in imperative, stateful programming. As programs grew large,
    they required increasingly Herculean efforts to change while maintaining all of
    the presumptions around state and relationships, never mind dealing with race
    conditions as concurrency was increasingly in play. And we faced encroaching, and
    eventually crippling, coupling, and huge codebases, due directly to specificity
    (best-practice encapsulation, abstraction, and parameterization notwithstanding).
    C++ builds of over an hour were common.
  </p>

  <p>
    In the years immediately preceding work on Clojure I worked on the system to be
    used for the national exit poll in the U.S. This system involved automating large
    statistical models. Early on we decided that an imperative approach to doing the
    stats was a misfit, being not mathematical and also due to the expected
    concurrency throughout the system. After exploring F# for the task (and finding
    it insufficiently expressive), we decided to code the stats in C# like the rest
    of the system (this was a Microsoft .Net shop). I designed some custom immutable
    data structures whose use would be co-aligned with the figures in the statistical
    specifications (so statisticians who did not know C# could look at the code and
    understand it), and a functional library for manipulating the structures and
    doing the calculations. This was a great success, yielding much simpler code that
    we did not, and still do not, worry about. However, the resulting C# code was, in
    the eyes of both new and experienced C# developers, bizarre and non-idiomatic.
    Thus functional programming was a win, but FP in a non-FP language was not
    something I could see being widely applied.
  </p>

  <h3>2.3 Who Do You Love?</h3>

  <p>
    I had always been a language geek, playing with Lisp, Prolog and Smalltalk in my
    spare time. When I became an independent consultant in
    <span class="timeline-item" id="inline-date--2000">2000</span>, I spent more time
    with Common Lisp [Steele Jr et al. 1990] and wrote a couple of real systems in
    it. It was a revelation. Huge layers of unnecessary complexity simply vanished. I
    had the flexibility to use exactly as much language as was needed for the
    problem. The percentage of code directly related to the domain increased.
    Development was much faster, the resulting program was more general and easier to
    change. It was impossible to avoid the sinking feeling that I had been “doing it
    wrong” by using C++/Java/C# my whole career. I needed another choice more like
    Common Lisp or I wouldn’t be able to continue as a professional software
    developer.
  </p>

  <p>
    While language features matter, the primary hurdle to language adoption by
    professionals is acceptability to developers and stakeholders. Thus, Clojure did
    have to be at minimum practical for developers I would work with, and companies I
    might work for, or else I couldn’t use it to make a living. I took this as an
    agenda item for its design but not as motivation to seek their input in advance,
    because at the time the advice from professional developers about Lisp was “it’s
    dead” and about functional programming was “what’s that?”, and about writing a
    new programming language was “you’re crazy”.
  </p>

  <p>
    The year <span class="timeline-item" id="inline-date--2005-2">2005</span> may
    have represented the nadir of language diversity in commercial software
    development, with ISVs primarily using C/C++ and many businesses considering
    themselves either Java or .Net ‘shops’. This was before the ascent of dynamic
    languages for web development (e.g., Ruby on Rails), and many companies were
    reluctant to deploy and operate anything that didn’t run on the JVM or CLR. I did
    commercial work in Common Lisp twice - a scheduling system and a yield management
    system. The first time the program had to be rewritten in C++ in order to be
    acceptable for deployment, an arduous task (though I was a seasoned C++
    programmer) that took longer than the initial development, was much more code,
    and did not run significantly faster. In the second case again Common Lisp was
    not acceptable for deployment, so I designed the program to generate SQL stored
    procedures for delivery to the client and runtime execution.
